# Species Distribution Model for five European tree species
A simple Species Distribution Model (SDM) applying a generalized linear model (GLM) in the R environment. Point occurences of five European tree species are linked to spatial data of three environmental variables (annuam mean temperature plus precipitation, elevation above sealevel). \
Some conceptual problems are present due to computational reasons: (i) the area limiting shapefile (retreived form the coastline shapefile) is larger than the area covered by the actual point occurences, leading to false peseudo-absences; (ii) the pseudo-absences were generated bbased on grid centroids, but centroid resolution was 100x100 km insteadt of 1x1 km given in the point occurence dataset.
